Project Euler solutions

Attempting to keep a habit going for regular coding that does not involve my projects/work. Focused on defining, documenting and improving my problem solving process. Will evolve this past [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) and into other code challenge sites at a future date. Decided to start with PE because of the simplicity of the site. This will make it easier to retrieve and submit issues via the commandline. I intend for this to evolve into a framework that provides an enviroment to solve coding challenges from websites across the net right in your IDE/editor of choice.
